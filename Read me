In this code:

    We import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
    We load the diabetes dataset and select a single feature (column) for simplicity.
    The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
    A linear regression model is created using LinearRegression() from scikit-learn.
    The model is trained on the training data using fit.
    We make predictions on the test data using predict.
    We calculate mean squared error and R-squared to evaluate the model's performance.
    Finally, we plot the training data points and the regression line to visualize the linear regression model's fit.
